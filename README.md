MVP:
Lauch goal is to have the hero page styled to mimic the main titles of the original Star Wars movie including animations.  The top level user interface page should display movie posters for each of the theater released Star Wars movies with each poster being clickable to their own "about page".  These "about pages" should provide, plot summary, release date, run time, director, clickable images of the main characters and thumbnail images of a few iconic scenes.  All clickable content should be animated with hover states and onclick style changes.

Post-MVP:
Future iterations could include comic, tv and merchandise links.  Also, original trailers marketing materials along with news coverage and interviews.  Each new element should contine to have a dynamic animated feature when the user interacts with it.
